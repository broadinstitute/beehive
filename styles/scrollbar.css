  This gimmick that's supported in some browsers lets us reserve space for scrollbars.
  This way they don't shift the layout when they're added.

  We reserve space on both sides, even though the scrollbar only shows up on the right,
  so that we can center elements normally.

  Most ideal would be to have an option for scrollbars with no background, but that's a
  user-agent behavior we can't impact.
